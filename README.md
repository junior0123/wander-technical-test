# Technical Test üîç

## Introduction

This repository showcases a framework for web automation utilizing **Playwright** and **Cucumber**. It features integrated loggers and reports to enhance test visibility and management. Explore the project to understand how automated tests are structured and executed effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have **Python** and **pip** installed on your system. You can verify your installations by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

If Python is not installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Pip is generally installed automatically with Python.

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:junior0123/wander-technical-test.git
   cd wander-technical-test
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

   This command creates a new virtual environment named `env` in your current directory.

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On **Windows**:

     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On **macOS** and **Linux**:

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

   Activating the virtual environment ensures that the installed libraries and Python commands run within this isolated environment.

## Installing Dependencies üì¶

1. **Install project dependencies:**

   Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install
   ```

## Running the Project üöÄ

To run the project and initiate the automated job search with integrated AI, follow these steps:

1. **Run the main script:**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   This command will start the job search process, where the AI analyzes job descriptions and compares the requirements with the user profile defined in the code.

2. **Running Tests by Marker:**

   You can also execute tests based on specific markers. Here are some examples:

   - **Location Filter Tests:**  
     ```bash
     pytest -m filter_location
     ```

   - **Date Filter Tests:**  
     ```bash
     pytest -m filter_dates
     ```

   - **Guest Filter Tests:**  
     ```bash
     pytest -m filter_guests
     ```

   - **Test Case Specific Markers:**
     - **TC-01:** Verify city selection and property listing functionality  
       ```bash
       pytest -m TC-01
       ```
     - **TC-02:** Verify multiple cities selection and filtering  
       ```bash
       pytest -m TC-02
       ```
     - **TC-03:** Validate date range selection and availability  
       ```bash
       pytest -m TC-03
       ```
     - **TC-04:** Verify guest count filter and property capacity  
       ```bash
       pytest -m TC-04
       ```

3. **Additional Configuration:**

   To ensure strict marker validation and generate HTML reports, include the following in your configuration file:

   ```ini
   addopts = --strict-markers --html=reports/report.html
   ```

4. **Viewing Results:**

   Results can be viewed in the generated report located in the `/reports` folder. Open `report.html` to access detailed test outcomes. If any issues arise, check the logs in the `/log` directory.

5. **Configuring Execution:**

   You can modify execution parameters in the `/config/config.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   default:
     base_url: "https://wander.com"  # Base URL for the tests
     browser: "chromium"               # Default browser: chromium, firefox, webkit
     headless: False                    # Run in headless mode (no UI)
     timeout: 10                        # Max wait time for actions (in seconds)
     slow_mo: 250                       # Delay actions to simulate human interaction (in milliseconds)
     retries: 2                         # Number of retries for a failed test
   ```

   You can also add additional tests in the `features` directory for execution.
